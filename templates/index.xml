          <li>ChangePassword</li>

        The RETS Server Compliance Checker is a desktop application written in Java using Swing 
        as its GUI. It uses the RETS Reference Implementation Java RETS API to connect to 
        RETS Servers.  All scripts are written in XML and are parameter-driven.
        Test Evaluators are Java classes.  All scripts and test evaluators are
        easily extensible and customizable. The compliance checker application is 
designed to run on both Windows and Unix platforms.
